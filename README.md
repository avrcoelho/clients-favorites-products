1. Fork the repo and create a new branch â€” or just create a new branch if you have permissions.

2. Once you have your local copy, install its dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Start [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) service OR run it using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):
